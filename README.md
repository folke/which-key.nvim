# üí• Which Key

**WhichKey** is a lua plugin for Neovim 0.5 that displays a popup with possible key bindings of
the command you started typing. Heavily inspired by the original [emacs-which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) and [vim-which-key](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-which-key).

## ‚ú® Features

* opens a popup with suggestions to complete a key binding
* works with any setting for [timeoutlen](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'timeoutlen'), including instantly (`timeoutlen=0`)
* works correctly with built-in key bindings
* works correctly with buffer-local mappings
* extensible plugin architecture
* built-in plugins:
  + **marks:** shows your marks when you hit one of the jump keys.
  + **registers:** shows the contents of your registers
  + **presets:** built-in key binding help for `motions`, `text-objects`, `operators`, `windows`, `nav`, `z` and `g`
  + **spelling:** spelling suggestions inside the which-key popup

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

* Neovim >= 0.5.0

## üì¶ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
" Vim Script
Plug 'folke/which-key.nvim'

lua << EOF
  require("which-key").setup {
    -- your configuration comes here
    -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
    -- refer to the configuration section below
  }
EOF
```

### [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
-- Lua
use {
  "folke/which-key.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("which-key").setup {
      -- your configuration comes here
      -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
      -- refer to the configuration section below
    }
  end
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

> ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT: the timeout when **WhichKey** opens is controlled by the vim setting [timeoutlen](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'timeoutlen').
> Please refer to the documentation to properly set it up. Setting it to `0`, will effectively
> always show **WhichKey** immediately, but a setting of `500` (500ms) is probably more appropriate.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è don't create any keymappings yourself to trigger WhichKey. Unlike with *vim-which-key*, we do this fully automatically.
> Please remove any left-over triggers you might have from using *vim-which-key*.

> üöë You can run `:checkhealth which_key` to see if there's any conflicting keymaps that will prevent triggering **WhichKey**

WhichKey comes with the following defaults:

```lua
{
  plugins = {
    marks = true, -- shows a list of your marks on ' and `
    registers = true, -- shows your registers on " in NORMAL or <C-r> in INSERT mode
    spelling = {
      enabled = false, -- enabling this will show WhichKey when pressing z= to select spelling suggestions
      suggestions = 20, -- how many suggestions should be shown in the list?
    },
    -- the presets plugin, adds help for a bunch of default keybindings in Neovim
    -- No actual key bindings are created
    presets = {
      operators = true, -- adds help for operators like d, y, ... and registers them for motion / text object completion
      motions = true, -- adds help for motions
      text_objects = true, -- help for text objects triggered after entering an operator
      windows = true, -- default bindings on <c-w>
      nav = true, -- misc bindings to work with windows
      z = true, -- bindings for folds, spelling and others prefixed with z
      g = true, -- bindings for prefixed with g
    },
  },
  -- add operators that will trigger motion and text object completion
  -- to enable all native operators, set the preset / operators plugin above
  operators = { gc = "Comments" },
  key_labels = {
    -- override the label used to display some keys. It doesn't effect WK in any other way.
    -- For example:
    -- ["<space>"] = "SPC",
    -- ["<cr>"] = "RET",
    -- ["<tab>"] = "TAB",
  },
  icons = {
    breadcrumb = "¬ª", -- symbol used in the command line area that shows your active key combo
    separator = "‚ûú", -- symbol used between a key and it's label
    group = "+", -- symbol prepended to a group
  },
  popup_mappings = {
    scroll_down = '<c-d>', -- binding to scroll down inside the popup
    scroll_up = '<c-u>', -- binding to scroll up inside the popup
  },
  window = {
    border = "none", -- none, single, double, shadow
    position = "bottom", -- bottom, top
    margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 }, -- extra window margin [top, right, bottom, left]
    padding = { 2, 2, 2, 2 }, -- extra window padding [top, right, bottom, left]
    winblend = 0
  },
  layout = {
    height = { min = 4, max = 25 }, -- min and max height of the columns
    width = { min = 20, max = 50 }, -- min and max width of the columns
    spacing = 3, -- spacing between columns
    align = "left", -- align columns left, center or right
  },
  ignore_missing = false, -- enable this to hide mappings for which you didn't specify a label
  hidden = { "<silent>", "<cmd>", "<Cmd>", "<CR>", "call", "lua", "^:", "^ "}, -- hide mapping boilerplate
  show_help = true, -- show help message on the command line when the popup is visible
  triggers = "auto", -- automatically setup triggers
  -- triggers = {"<leader>"} -- or specify a list manually
  triggers_blacklist = {
    -- list of mode / prefixes that should never be hooked by WhichKey
    -- this is mostly relevant for key maps that start with a native binding
    -- most people should not need to change this
    i = { "j", "k" },
    v = { "j", "k" },
  },
}
```

## ü™Ñ Setup

With the default settings, **WhichKey** will work out of the box for most builtin keybindings,
but the real power comes from documenting and organizing your own keybindings.

To document and/or setup your own mappings, you need to call the `register` method

```lua
local wk = require("which-key")
wk.register(mappings, opts)
```

Default options for `opts`

```lua
{
  mode = "n", -- NORMAL mode
  -- prefix: use "<leader>f" for example for mapping everything related to finding files
  -- the prefix is prepended to every mapping part of `mappings`
  prefix = "",
  buffer = nil, -- Global mappings. Specify a buffer number for buffer local mappings
  silent = true, -- use `silent` when creating keymaps
  noremap = true, -- use `noremap` when creating keymaps
  nowait = false, -- use `nowait` when creating keymaps
}
```

> ‚ùï When you specify a command in your mapping that starts with `<Plug>`, then we automatically set `noremap=false`, since you always want recursive keybindings in this case

### ‚å®Ô∏è Mappings

Group names use the special `name` key in the tables. There's multiple ways to define the mappings. `wk.register` can be called multiple times from anywhere in your config files.

```lua
local wk = require("which-key")
-- As an example, we will create the following mappings:
--  * <leader>ff find files
--  * <leader>fr show recent files
--  * <leader>fb Foobar
-- we'll document:
--  * <leader>fn new file
--  * <leader>fe edit file
-- and hide <leader>1

wk.register({
  f = {
    name = "file", -- optional group name
    f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" }, -- create a binding with label
    r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File", noremap=false, buffer = 123 }, -- additional options for creating the keymap
    n = { "New File" }, -- just a label. don't create any mapping
    e = "Edit File", -- same as above
    ["1"] = "which_key_ignore",  -- special label to hide it in the popup
    b = { function() print("bar") end, "Foobar" } -- you can also pass functions!
  },
}, { prefix = "<leader>" })
```

<summary>Click to see more examples</summary>

```lua
-- all of the mappings below are equivalent

-- method 2
wk.register({
  ["<leader>"] = {
    f = {
      name = "+file",
      f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
      r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
      n = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
    },
  },
})

-- method 3
wk.register({
  ["<leader>f"] = {
    name = "+file",
    f = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
    r = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
    n = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
  },
})

-- method 4
wk.register({
  ["<leader>f"] = { name = "+file" },
  ["<leader>ff"] = { "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find File" },
  ["<leader>fr"] = { "<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Open Recent File" },
  ["<leader>fn"] = { "<cmd>enew<cr>", "New File" },
})
```

</details>

**Tips:** The default label is `keymap.desc` or `keymap.rhs` or `""`,
 `:h nvim_set_keymap()` to get more details about `desc` and `rhs`.


### üöô Operators, Motions and Text Objects

**WhichKey** provides help to work with operators, motions and text objects.

> `[count]operator[count][text-object]`

* operators can be configured with the `operators` option
  + set `plugins.presets.operators` to `true` to automatically configure vim built-in operators
  + set this to `false`, to only include the list you configured in the `operators` option.
  + see [here](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/which-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L5) for the full list part of the preset
* text objects are automatically retrieved from **operator pending** key maps (`omap`)
  + set `plugins.presets.text_objects` to `true` to configure built-in text objects
  + see [here](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/which-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L43)
* motions are part of the preset `plugins.presets.motions` setting
  + see [here](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/which-key/plugins/presets/init.lua#L20)

<details>
<summary>How to disable some operators? (like v)</summary>

```lua
-- make sure to run this code before calling setup()
-- refer to the full lists at https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim/blob/main/lua/which-key/plugins/presets/init.lua
local presets = require("which-key.plugins.presets")
presets.operators["v"] = nil
```

</details>

## üöÄ Usage

When the **WhichKey** popup is open, you can use the following key bindings (they are also displayed at the bottom of the screen):

* hit one of the keys to open a group or execute a key binding
* `<esc>` to cancel and close the popup
* `<bs>` go up one level
* `<c-d>` scroll down
* `<c-u>` scroll up

Apart from the automatic opening, you can also  manually open **WhichKey** for a certain `prefix`:

> ‚ùóÔ∏è don't create any keymappings yourself to trigger WhichKey. Unlike with *vim-which-key*, we do this fully automatically.
> Please remove any left-over triggers you might have from using *vim-which-key*.

```vim
:WhichKey " show all mappings
:WhichKey <leader> " show all <leader> mappings
:WhichKey <leader> v " show all <leader> mappings for VISUAL mode
:WhichKey '' v " show ALL mappings for VISUAL mode
```

## üî• Plugins

Four built-in plugins are included with **WhichKey**.

### Marks

Shows a list of your buffer local and global marks when you hit \` or '

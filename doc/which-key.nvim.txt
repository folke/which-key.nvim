1. Which Key                                        *which-key.nvim-which-key*

**WhichKey** helps you remember your Neovim keymaps, by showing available
keybindings in a popup as you type.




FEATURES                                   *which-key.nvim-which-key-features*

- **Key Binding Help**show available keybindings in a popup as you type.
- **Modes**works in normal, insert, visual, operator pending, terminal and command mode.
    Every mode can be enabled/disabled.
- **Customizable Layouts**choose from `classic`, `modern`, and `helix` presets or customize the window.
- **Flexible Sorting**sort by `local`, `order`, `group`, `alphanum`, `mod`, `lower`, `icase`, `desc`, or `manual`.
- **Formatting**customizable key labels and descriptions
- **Icons**integrates with mini.icons <https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.icons> and nvim-web-devicons <https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons>
- **Delay**delay is independent of `timeoutlen`
- **Plugins**built-in plugins for marks, registers, presets, and spelling suggestions
- **Operators, Motions, Text Objects**help for operators, motions and text objects
- **Hydra Mode**keep the popup open until you hit `<esc>`


REQUIREMENTS                           *which-key.nvim-which-key-requirements*

      "folke/which-key.nvim",
      event = "VeryLazy",
      opts = {
        -- your configuration comes here

MAPPINGS                                   *which-key.nvim-which-key-mappings*

**WhichKey** automatically gets the descriptions of your keymaps from the
`desc` attribute of the keymap. So for most use-cases, you don’t need to do
anything else.

However, the **mapping spec** is still useful to configure group descriptions
and mappings that don’t really exist as a regular keymap.


  [!WARNING] The **mappings spec** changed in `v3`, so make sure to only use the
  new `add` method if you updated your existing mappings.
Mappings can be added as part of the config `opts.spec`, or can be added later
using `require("which-key").add()`. `wk.add()` can be called multiple times
from anywhere in your config files.

A mapping has the following attributes:

- **[1]**(`string`) lhs **(required)**
- **[2]**(`string|fun()`) rhs **(optional)**when present, it will create the mapping
- **desc**(`string|fun():string`) description **(required for non-groups)**
- **group**(`string|fun():string`) group name **(optional)**
- **mode**(`string|string[]`) mode **(optional, defaults to "n")**
- **cond**(`boolean|fun():boolean`) condition to enable the mapping **(optional)**
- **hidden**(`boolean`) hide the mapping **(optional)**
- **icon**(`string|wk.Icon|fun():(wk.Icon|string)`) icon spec **(optional)**
- **proxy**(`string`) proxy to another mapping **(optional)**
- **expand**(`fun():wk.Spec`) nested mappings **(optional)**
- any other option valid for `vim.keymap.set`. These are only used for creating mappings.

When `desc`, `group`, or `icon` are functions, they are evaluated every time
the popup is shown.

The `expand` property allows to create dynamic mappings. Only functions as
`rhs` are supported for dynamic mappings. Two examples are included in
`which-key.extras`

- `require("which-key.extras").expand.buf`creates numerical key to buffer mappings
- `require("which-key.extras").expand.win`creates numerical key to window mappings

>lua
    local wk = require("which-key")
    wk.add({
      { "<leader>f", group = "file" }, -- group
      { "<leader>ff", "<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", desc = "Find File", mode = "n" },
      { "<leader>fb", function() print("hello") end, desc = "Foobar" },
      { "<leader>fn", desc = "New File" },
      { "<leader>f1", hidden = true }, -- hide this keymap
      { "<leader>w", proxy = "<c-w>", group = "windows" }, -- proxy to window mappings
      { "<leader>b", group = "buffers", expand = function()
          return require("which-key.extras").expand.buf()
        end
      },
      {
        -- Nested mappings are allowed and can be added in any order
        -- Most attributes can be inherited or overridden on any level
        -- There's no limit to the depth of nesting
        mode = { "n", "v" }, -- NORMAL and VISUAL mode
        { "<leader>q", "<cmd>q<cr>", desc = "Quit" }, -- no need to specify mode since it's inherited
        { "<leader>w", "<cmd>w<cr>", desc = "Write" },
      }
    })

TRIGGERS                                   *which-key.nvim-which-key-triggers*

There’s two ways that **which-key** can be triggered:

- by a trigger keymap
- by a `ModeChanged` event for visual and operator pending mode

Both can be configured using `opts.triggers` and `opts.defer`.

By default `opts.triggers` includes `{ "<auto>", mode = "nixsotc" }`, which
will setup keymap triggers for every mode automatically and will trigger during
`ModeChanged`.


  [!NOTE] Auto triggers will never be created for existing keymaps. That includes
  every valid single key Neovim builtin mapping. If you want to trigger on a
  builtin keymap, you have to add it manually.
  >lua
       triggers = {
         { "<auto>", mode = "nixsotc" },
         { "a", mode = { "n", "v" } },
       }
  <

  [!TIP] To manually setup triggers, you can set `opts.triggers` to:
  >lua
       triggers = {
         { "<leader>", mode = { "n", "v" } },
       }
  <
For `ModeChanged` triggers, you can configure the `opts.defer` option. When it
returns `true`, the popup will be shown only after an additional key is
pressed. So `yaf`, would show which-key after pressing `ya`, but not after `y`.


  [!TIP] Defer some operators:
  >lua
      ---@param ctx { mode: string, operator: string }
      defer = function(ctx)
        if vim.list_contains({ "d", "y" }, ctx.operator) then
          return true
        end
        return vim.list_contains({ "<C-V>", "V" }, ctx.mode)
      end,
  <

ICONS                                         *which-key.nvim-which-key-icons*


  [!note] For full support, you need to install either mini.icons
  <https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.icons> or nvim-web-devicons
  <https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons>
There’s multiple ways to set icons for your keymaps:

- if you use lazy.nvim, then some icons will be autodetected for keymaps belonging to certain plugins.
- custom rules to decide what icon to use
- in your mapping spec, you can specify what icon to use at any level, so at the node for `<leader>g` for example, to apply to all git keymaps.

The `icon` attribute of a mapping can be a `string`, which will be used as the
actual icon, or an `wk.Icon` object, which can have the following attributes:

- `icon` (`string`): the icon to use **(optional)**
- `hl` (`string`): the highlight group to use for the icon **(optional)**
- `color` (`string`): the color to use for the icon **(optional)**
    valid colors are: `azure`, `blue`, `cyan`, `green`, `grey`, `orange`, `purple`, `red`, `yellow`
- `cat` (`string`): the category of the icon **(optional)**
    valid categories are: `file`, `filetype`, `extension`
- `name` (`string`): the name of the icon in the specified category **(optional)**


  [!TIP] If you’d rather not use icons, you can disable them by setting
  `opts.icons.mappings` to `false`.

USAGE                                         *which-key.nvim-which-key-usage*

When the **WhichKey** popup is open, you can use the following key bindings
(they are also displayed at the bottom of the screen):

- hit one of the keys to open a group or execute a key binding
- `<esc>` to cancel and close the popup
- `<bs>` go up one level
- `<c-d>` scroll down
- `<c-u>` scroll up


HYDRA MODE                               *which-key.nvim-which-key-hydra-mode*

Hydra mode is a special mode that keeps the popup open until you hit `<esc>`.

>lua
    -- Show hydra mode for changing windows
    require("which-key").show({
      keys = "<c-w>",
      loop = true, -- this will keep the popup open until you hit <esc>
    })
<


PLUGINS                                     *which-key.nvim-which-key-plugins*

Four built-in plugins are included with **WhichKey**.


PRESETS ~

Built-in key binding help for `motions`, `text-objects`, `operators`,
`windows`, `nav`, `z` and `g` and more.


MARKS ~

Shows a list of your buffer local and global marks when you hit ` or ’


REGISTERS ~

Shows a list of your buffer local and global registers when you hit ” in
_NORMAL_ mode, or `<c-r>` in _INSERT_ mode.


SPELLING ~

When enabled, this plugin hooks into `z=` and replaces the full-screen spelling
suggestions window by a list of suggestions within **WhichKey**.
